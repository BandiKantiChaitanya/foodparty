    "name": "Kadhai Paneer ",
    "description": "Kadhai Paneer is a classic North Indian dish made with paneer cubes sautéed in a spicy and flavorful tomato-based gravy. The dish is known for its bold use of freshly ground spices, including coriander seeds and red chilies, which give it its signature aroma and vibrant color. Bell peppers and onions are cooked until slightly tender to add crunch and depth, while ginger-garlic paste enhances the overall richness of the dish. The paneer remains soft and absorbs the flavors beautifully, making it a favorite among vegetarians. Often served with naan, roti, or jeera rice, Kadhai Paneer is a staple in Indian restaurants and households alike. It’s a dish that brings warmth, comfort, and the taste of tradition in every bite.",

    "name": "Tandoori Chicken",
    "description": "Tandoori Chicken is a beloved Indian dish known for its smoky, spicy, and tangy flavor. It begins with chicken pieces marinated in a mixture of thick yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, and a special blend of spices like cumin, coriander, and Kashmiri red chili powder. This marinade tenderizes the chicken and infuses it with rich flavor. Traditionally, it’s cooked in a clay tandoor oven, which gives the chicken its signature charred edges and deep smokiness, but it can also be grilled or baked at home. The outer layer turns crisp and slightly burnt, while the inside remains juicy and flavorful. Tandoori Chicken is usually served with fresh lemon wedges, onion rings, and mint chutney. It's a perfect choice as a starter or part of the main course. Despite its fiery look, the heat level can be adjusted, making it enjoyable for a wide range of palates. Whether served at parties, family dinners, or special occasions, Tandoori Chicken always makes a bold and delicious impression.",
